# BulletJournal inspired states

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Saeden/obsidian-bujo-checkbox?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

This plugin allows you to have multiple states for the checkbox. These states correspond to a half-done task. A migrated task (moved to a Monthly, Weekly or subsequent Daily log) and a scheduled task (moved to the Future log). Based on the BulletJournal Method
Currently in testing phase.

Forked from [Checkbox 3 states plugin](https://github.com/hrenaud/obsidian-checkbox3states-plugin)

## How to use.

On desktop, [CLICK] on a checkbox to cycle through the different states. Currently there are three new ones implemented, according to important actions of the BulletJournal method. [SHIFT]+[CLICK] is planned to reset the checkbox but that has not been implemented yet. 

On mobile/touch device, do a long press to toggle. (Also not implemented yet.)

## How to customize colors

Open **Obisdian settings**, in the `Community plugins` list choose **BulletJournal Checkbox States**.

In this panel, set the two colors:

-   `Half completed state base color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state.
-   `Half completed state hover color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state when it is hovered with the mouse.

The other states colours can be set in a similar manner.
