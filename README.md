# BulletJournal inspired states

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Saeden/obsidian-bujo-checkbox?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

This plugin allows you to have multiple states for the checkbox. These states correspond to a half-done task. A migrated task (moved to a Monthly, Weekly or subsequent Daily log) and a scheduled task (moved to the Future log).
Currently in testing phase.

Forked from [Checkbox 3 states plugin](https://github.com/hrenaud/obsidian-checkbox3states-plugin)

## How to use.

~~On desktop, do a [SHIFT]+[CLICK] on a checkbox to set this third state (not fully done).~~

~~On mobile/touch device, do a long press to toggle.~~

~~## How to customize colors~~

~~Open **Obisdian settings**, in the `Community plugins` list choose **Checkbox 3 states**.~~

~~In this panel, set the two colors:~~

~~-   `Base color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state.~~
~~-   `Hover color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state when it is hovered with the mouse.~~
